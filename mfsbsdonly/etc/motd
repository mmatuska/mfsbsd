Welcome to mfsBSD, the memory based FreeBSD distribution.

This is a stripped-down version of FreeBSD without:
- manual pages, info pages, examples
- include files, static library files, development tools
- bind binaries (named, etc.)

Visit https://github.com/mmatuska/mfsbsd
for bug reports or feature suggestions.
