Welcome to mfsBSD SE, the memory based FreeBSD distribution.
This is a special version intended for full-ZFS install of FreeBSD

To make a full-ZFS FreeBSD install from this ISO:

1. Mount the CD device 
( e.g. mount_cd9660 /dev/cd0 /cdrom )
2. Run "zfsinstall" with path to release directory and your drive
( e.g. zfsinstall -d ada0 -u /cdrom/9.2-RELEASE-amd64 )

Run zfsinstall with the -h flag for help or without flags for options.
I recommend creating a GPT swap partition (e.g. -s 2G for a 2GB swap).

Feel free to email me with any bug reports or feature suggestions.
