Welcome to mfsBSD, the memory based FreeBSD distribution.

This is a stripped-down version of FreeBSD without:
- manual pages, info pages, examples
- include files, static library files, development tools
- bind binaries (host, dig, named, etc.)

Feel free to email me with any bug reports or feature suggestions.
